See git root README.md for more information.

USAGE:
  project:
      oimp setup_project [NAME] [DEST_DIR]

  scenario:
      oimp scenario update [NAME]
      oimp scenario validate [NAME]

  test_config:
      A test_config is a set of one or more scenarios to be executed together.

      oimp test_config
            List all defined test_configs defined in your_oimp_suite_dir/suite_config/scenarios.yaml
      oimp test_config [NAME]
            Execute test config [NAME]

  program:
      A program is a set of test_configs to be executed together. LoadImpact normally limits us to three
      simultaneous test_configs running. On running a program the test_configs will be reconfigured according
      scenarios listed under each config setting in the program.

      oimp program
            List the names of all defined programs defined in your_oimp_suite_dir/suite_config/programs
      oimp program [NAME] [RUN_DESCRIPTION]
            Execute the program [NAME]
            NAME - The name of the program definition file to be executed.
            RUN_DESCRIPTION - Something like "20 web fronts, Redis DB". Mandatory description of setup.

  sequence:
      A sequence is a sequence of programs to be executed one after another.

      oimp sequence
            List the names of all defined sequences defined in your_oimp_suite_dir/suite_config/sequences
      oimp sequence [NAME] [RUN_DESCRIPTION]
            Execute the sequence [NAME]
            NAME - The name of the sequence definition file to be executed.
            RUN_DESCRIPTION - Something like "20 web fronts, Redis DB". Mandatory description of setup.

  report:
      Reports are html reports with svg charts displaying the results of runs.

      oimp report program
            List the PROGRAM_RUN_ID for all program executions.
      oimp report program completed [PROGRAM_RUN_ID]
            Create a report for a completed program run.
      oimp report program running [PROGRAM_RUN_ID]
            Create a dynamically updating report for a program run currently being executed.
      oimp report program combine [PROGRAM_RUN_ID,PROGRAM_RUN_ID,...]
            Create a combined comparative report for a set of completed program runs.
      oimp report test_config
            List the RUN_ID for all test_config executions.
      oimp report test_config completed [RUN_ID] [TITLE]
            Create a report for a completed test_config run.
            TITLE - optional title for report.
      oimp report test_config running [RUN_ID] [TITLE]
            Create a dynamically updating report for a test_config run currently being executed.
            TITLE - optional title for report.

  targets:
      Targets are a set of load targets (requests/s goals) defined in your_oimp_suite_dir/suite_config/targets.yml.
      They are used in reports to compare actual numbers with what we aim at reaching.

      oimp target
            List targets

  api_method:
      api_method allows custom calls to the LoadImpact API endpoints.
